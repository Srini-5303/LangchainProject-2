This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. 
We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database. 
User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database. 
Srini Tees is a T-shirt store where they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database. 
A store manager can ask questions such as,
  1) How many tshirts are left in Levi's brand that is blue in color?
  2) What will be the total price if we sell all the Adidas tshirts after the discount on the brand?
